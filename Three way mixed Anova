## **Check Assumptions**

### **Identify outliers**

df$Index <- paste(df$Geno, df$Photoperiod, df$Treatment, df$PlantID, sep = "_")

df_out<-df %>%
  group_by(Genotype, Treatment, Photoperiod) %>%
  identify_outliers(LT_mean)

df_out

### **Dropping outliers**

dfout<-df_out[which(df_out$is.outlier=="TRUE"),]

dfout


df2<-df[-which(df$Index %in% dfout$Index),]


### **Normality assumption**

df2 %>%
  group_by(Treatment,Photoperiod, Genotype) %>%
  shapiro_test(LT_mean)

### **Create QQ plot for each cell of design:**

ggqqplot(df2, "LT_mean", ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  facet_grid(Photoperiod ~ Treatment, labeller = "label_both")


### **Homogneity of variance assumption**
  
df2 %>%
  group_by(Photoperiod) %>%
  levene_test(LT_mean ~ Genotype*Treatment)

### **Assumption of sphericity** : The Mauchly's test of sphericity and the sphericity corrections are internally 
      #done using the R function anova_test() and get_anova_table() [rstatix package].

## **Computation**

#### **Key arguments for performing repeated measures ANOVA:**

# data:data frame
# 
# dv:(numeric) the dependent (or outcome) variable name.
# 
# wid:variable name specifying the case/sample identifier.
# 
# between: between-subjects factor or grouping variable
# 
# within:within-subjects factor or grouping variable


res.aov <- anova_test(data = df, 
                      dv = LT_mean, wid = PlantID,
                      within = Photoperiod, between = c(Genotype,Treatment)
)

get_anova_table(res.aov)


#There was no significant three-way interaction between  Genotype,Treatment and Photoperiod, F(4, 66) = 0.692, p = 0.6.
#But there was statistically significant two way interactions of Genotype and Photoperiod F(4, 66) = 12.04, p < 0.001 
#and, Treatment and Phototperiod F(4, 66) = 10.39, p < 0.001.**
  
## **Post-hoc tests**
  
#Compute simple two way interaction for **Genotype and Treatment** at each level of photoperiod
  
  Geno.Treat <- df2 %>%
  group_by(Photoperiod) %>%
  anova_test(dv = LT_mean, wid = PlantID, between = c(Genotype, Treatment))

  ### **Compute simple simple main effects**
  
  #In our study, we could investigate the effect of Treatment on leaf temperatures at every level of Photoperiod. Note that, we will only need to do this for simple two-way interaction for "gi" mutants as those were the only simple two-way interactions that were statistically significant.*
  
  #Group the data by Photoperiod and Genotype, and analyze the simple main effect of Treatment on Leaf temperatures:

  anova_test(dv = LT_mean, wid = PlantID, between = Treatment)

photoperiod.effect


#There was statistically significant simple simple main effect of Treatment on the leaf temperatures for *gi* mutants at all three time points**
  
  ### **Compute simple simple comparisons**
  
pwc <- df2 %>%
  filter(Genotype == "gi-2") %>% 
  group_by(Genotype, Photoperiod) %>% 
  pairwise_t_test(LT_mean ~ Treatment, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni") %>%

### **Compute pairwaise comparison for signficant differences between Col and *gi* mutants over photoperiod**
